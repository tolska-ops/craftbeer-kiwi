# craftbeer.kiwi — Project Retrospective

**Covers:** 9 July 2026 to 20 July 2026 (project inception to current session)
**Purpose:** A high-level, time-boxed view of how the project actually unfolded — useful for spotting where effort went, what took longer than expected, and what a realistic pace looks like for planning future phases (e.g. national expansion). This is a companion to architecture.md (what's built) and craftbeer-kiwi-automation-plan.md (what's planned) — this doc is about how the building went, not what exists.

Time estimates are approximate, reconstructed from session content and scope rather than logged timestamps — treat them as ballpark, not precise. At Andy's stated pace of roughly 5-8 hrs/week, total effort to date (approx. 18-22 hrs across 12 days) tracks roughly as expected for someone fitting this around a full-time job.

## Block 1 - Concept and planning (9-11 July) - approx 4.5 hrs

- Implementation guide drafted and delivered as PDF; troubleshot a wkhtmltopdf rendering bug (forced page-breaks causing blank pages), fixed via CSS page-break-inside: avoid
- Initial scaffold attempted with Create React App, hit deprecation warnings - pivoted to Vite (CRA officially deprecated Feb 2025)
- Chose ESLint over Oxlint for better ecosystem/learning-resource support
- Dependencies installed: react-map-gl, mapbox-gl, @supabase/supabase-js, axios
- Standing rule established: always verify package names/commands against current sources rather than training data, after an incorrect package name caused a failed install
- Strategic pivot: domain craftbeer.kiwi (owned speculatively since 2016) reframed from "monetise this" to "build a learning project" - Claude pushed back on jumping to solutions before the actual goal was clear
- MVP scope locked: Wellington-region craft brewery directory with map, tour tracking, gamified check-ins - inspired by South Shore/Idaho brewery trail apps
- Stack decided: React + Mapbox + Supabase + Vercel, deliberately chosen over a no-code alternative as a hands-on learning exercise
- Part 1 implementation guide rewritten for a beginner-friendly, fully-spelled-out audience (Node install, Supabase UI navigation, .env.local, SQL editor, dev server)

## Block 2 - Core build: schema, map, seed data (13 July) - approx 4.5 hrs

The single biggest session to date - described in its own summary as covering "an enormous amount of ground."

- breweries table created and seeded with all 18 verified Wellington-region breweries
- Automation-support schema columns added: is_active, last_verified, place_id, flagged_for_review
- Mapbox integration: react-map-gl, supercluster clustering, custom-themed pins per brewery (getBreweryTheme), styled popups, dark header
- Deployed live to Vercel (craftbeer-kiwi.vercel.app), connected to GitHub for auto-deploy
- Three real-world data corrections caught and fixed mid-session: Fortune Favours (closed, now a Garage Project site), Tuatara (relocated to Brewtown), Boneface (changed ownership) - plus Waitoa added as a missing 18th brewery
- README.md, architecture.md, craftbeer-kiwi-automation-plan.md written and pushed to GitHub - first full documentation set
- Automation plan substantially designed: Places + NZBN two-source verification model, exceptions report query, Phase 2 sources scoped (MoJ register, NZ Customs Excise CCA list)
- Project instructions added to prompt proactive doc-update flags going forward

## Block 3 - Automation infrastructure setup (15 July) - approx 3 hrs

- NZ Customs Excise CCA list cross-checked against all 18 breweries - two apparent mismatches (Panhead/Neilson, Mean Doses' two addresses) investigated and resolved with zero open items
- Automation plan doc reconstructed in full after it was found to have lost content between sessions
- Google Cloud set up as a business account under Craft Beer Kiwi Collective Limited: project created, billing enabled, Places API (New) enabled, restricted API key generated and stored in Bitwarden
- Supabase CLI installed as an npm dev dependency, linked to the live project, brewery-sync Edge Function scaffolded (empty template)
- FreeFileSync configured for local backup to USB (Mirror mode, node_modules excluded)
- To-do logged: enable 2FA on GitHub/Supabase/Vercel - still outstanding as of today
- architecture.md reviewed and updated to reflect schema/automation progress

## Block 4 - Mobile triage and discovery gap (17 July) - approx 1 hr

Short, mobile-only session - bug logging and one significant finding rather than implementation.

- Three mobile popup bugs identified and queued (header obscuring, popup not closing on pin-switch, long names overlapping close button)
- Garage Project Wild Workshop found missing from the directory - surfaced a genuine blind spot in the automation design: name-based discovery treats multiple venues under one brand as duplicates. Drafted (but not yet merged) as a new automation-plan section
- Product roadmap clarified: Wellington then national NZ then Australia, in that order, not straight to Australia after Wellington
- Domain/multi-country branding strategy discussed and deliberately deferred

## Block 5 - Feature-heavy build day (19 July) - approx 3.5 hrs

- Full website field audit: 7 of 18 breweries found null, corrected via verified web search plus SQL update; standing rule established (never leave website null on a new brewery)
- Same standing-rule treatment applied to brewery pin theming - Waitoa found missing an explicit theme entry, fixed
- Shipped: light/dark map toggle (OS-preference-aware, localStorage-persisted), fly-to animation on pin click, GeolocateControl, rebuilt popup close button (proper touch target sizing), temporarily-closed brewery status system (status/status_note fields)
- 3D terrain trialled and deliberately reverted same session - logged in architecture.md specifically to prevent re-investigation later
- All three mobile popup bugs from 17 July fixed and confirmed on real iPhone hardware
- Domain-to-Vercel connection attempt blocked by a genuine Discount Domains portal bug (confirmed via incognito test, not user error) - call to their support logged as the next step
- Closure-check logic scoped (not yet written): decided a lone Places "closed" signal should flag for review, not auto-close, per the existing two-source-agreement rule

## Block 6 - Planning-only session (20 July, earlier) - approx 0.5 hr

- Notes-focused session on two upcoming features: a custom user-location marker (extending the existing GeolocateControl) and client-side brewery name search
- No implementation - scoped for a future build session, including extracting a dedicated SearchBar.jsx component

## Block 7 - Closure-check and discovery automation (20 July, this session) - approx 4 hrs

The longest single technical session - closure-check built end-to-end, discovery built but blocked mid-testing, plus real doc-hygiene work.

- Flagged and corrected a doc/behaviour mismatch in the automation plan before writing any code
- brewery-sync (closure-check) written, deployed, and successfully tested: checked:18, flagged:0, errors:[]
- Adapted to a Supabase platform change mid-session - the withSupabase/@supabase/server auth pattern superseded the plan's original manual-client approach
- Significant troubleshooting saga: exposed secret key rotated, but new keys consistently failed with 401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS across two independently generated keys, three test methods (PowerShell, curl, dashboard test panel), and a redeploy - concluded as a genuine Supabase platform-side issue, not user error, and logged for support/GitHub-thread follow-up
- brewery-discover (discovery) built and deployed as a deliberately separate function from closure-check (cost-tier and risk-isolation reasoning) - not yet successfully tested, blocked by the same key issue
- Multi-site blind-spot section (drafted 17 July) finally merged into the automation plan, alongside the closure-check/discovery restructure
- architecture.md and craftbeer-kiwi-automation-plan.md both substantially rewritten to match actual current state - including catching that an earlier "doc saved automatically" claim this session was wrong, and correcting course
- Two security to-dos actioned: old exposed secret key deleted (new one blocked on the same platform issue); 2FA on GitHub/Supabase/Vercel still not done - carried forward again

## Patterns worth noting

- Documentation drift is a recurring theme. At least three sessions (15 July, 17 July's unmerged addition, today) involved discovering that docs had fallen behind actual build state, or that edits made in one place didn't persist to another. Worth treating doc updates as part of "done," not a follow-up task, going forward.
- Tooling underneath shifts mid-project. CRA to Vite (block 1) and the Supabase auth pattern change (block 7) both required adapting to an external tool changing out from under the plan, not a planning failure on Andy's part.
- The biggest time sinks were infrastructure/tooling friction, not application logic. The closure-check logic itself was straightforward; the PowerShell/key-rotation/auth-pattern troubleshooting around it consumed most of block 7's time. Worth factoring into future estimates - new-tool setup tends to cost more than the feature work it enables.
- 2FA has now been carried forward as an open to-do across three sessions (15, 19, 20 July) without being actioned. Small task, worth just doing next session before it becomes a fourth carry-forward.
